Muscle Memory (The body's ability to "remember" skills even when the mind forgets the names.)
Atrophy (The biological wasting away of the muscle itself, making the "memory" physically impossible to execute.)
Anabolic Steroids (Synthetic hormones that force muscle growth and prevent atrophy even under stress.)
Liver Failure (A common lethal side effect of steroid abuse that shuts down the body regardless of how big the muscles are.)
Dialysis Machine (The mechanical bypass that filters the blood and keeps the body alive despite organ failure.)
A Power Outage (A simple loss of electricity renders the life-sustaining machine a heavy paperweight.)
A Backup Generator (Ensures the power stays on even when the grid fails.)
Fuel Contamination (Sugar or water in the gas tank that bricks the generator's engine.)
Solar Power (An energy source that requires no liquid fuel and has no moving engine parts to gum up.)
Cloud Seeding (The intentional manipulation of the weather to block the sun and kill the solar output.)
Atmospheric Carbon Scrubbers (Machines that strip the seeding chemicals and CO₂ out of the air to restore clarity.)
Cyber-Espionage (Hacking the software of the scrubbers to make them release toxins instead of cleaning the air.)
Analog Controls (Hard-wired manual levers that cannot be hacked because they aren't connected to a network.)
Corrosion (The slow, chemical eating away of metal levers, making manual control impossible over time.)
Stainless Steel / Chrome Plating (Materials specifically designed to resist oxidation and corrosion.)
Aqua Regia (The "Royal Water" acid mixture that can dissolve even the most "noble" and corrosion-resistant metals.)
Glass Lining (Glass is inert to almost all acids, including Aqua Regia, providing a perfect chemical shield.)
Thermal Shock (Rapidly changing the temperature to shatter the brittle glass lining instantly.)
Pyrex (Borosilicate Glass) (Engineered to withstand extreme thermal expansion and contraction without cracking.)
A Diamond-Tipped Drill (The hardest material, capable of physically puncturing the borosilicate glass regardless of temperature.)
